        <p>Don’t you just love exploring beautiful and neat sites with a clean user interface? While most of us would
            reply
            with an assertive ‘YES,’ little, do we know the kind of effort and skill that goes into making a website
            attractive and user-friendly. The secret to creating an impressive site is to master the art of front-end
            development, and no, it is not as easy as it seems!</p>
        <!-- paragraph 2 -->
        <p> However, it is not impossible either. Here are five tips
            that’ll help you get better in front-end design and web development. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>
                <h4 class="uppercase">Commenting</h4>
                <p>Commenting is one such practice that is often ignored by programmers, especially for codes that are
                    written
                    by multiple programmers. But remember, commenting is an important part of project you create. With
                    proper
                    comments and organised files its always easier for you or others to jump in and understand where
                    things
                    are
                    at and how they work.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="uppercase">Invest In Productive Tools.</h4>
                <p> The Internet is teeming with a host of web development tools, from browser add-ons to smart plugins,
                    the
                    amount of choices available now is massive! So, why not invest in some really productive web tools
                    that’ll
                    help you improve your front-end designing skills? Tools like Sublime Text, jQuery, Emmet, Bootstrap,
                    and
                    Sass are nothing short of a godsend for web developers. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="uppercase">Always Be Curious.</h4>
                <p> A front-end developer has to keep himself/herself updated continuously with the latest news and
                    innovations
                    in the field. You need to take a proactive stand and learn new things about front-end development
                    from
                    informative blogs and videos. Following are some of the most informative and useful learning sources
                    for
                    front-end developers</p>

            <li>
                <h4 class="uppercase">Refactor Your Code From Time To Time.</h4>
                <p> By “refactoring” your code, you’re only enhancing the code without tampering with its functionality.
                    This will improve the quality and readability quotient of your code and the more often you do it,
                    your code will continually be updated into a cleaner and fresher version of what it was before.
                    Apart
                    from that, one of the most significant advantages that refactoring offers is that it ensures your
                    code
                    remains free from plagiarism.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="uppercase">Version Control</h4>
                <p> As a developer, version control is something that you must know about. Version control systems let
                    you
                    keep track of changes made to the code over time. And not just this, they also make it easy to
                    revert
                    back to an earlier version if you screw something up. Thus using verion control will save you some
                    sleepless nights for sure. One of the most widely used version control systems is Git. Thus knowing
                    git
                    has been a requirement for almost every development job these days. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4 class="uppercase">Automate !</h4>
                <p>There are many ways to represent state in modern web applications. In React, you can either
                    encapsulate your state locally within components or manage your state globally using a state
                    management library like Redux. Whichever way the state of an app is represented, it is usually
                    represented by components which can be changed to determine how the app is viewed.
                    When structuring apps, you may be required to have a stylesheet for each form of state your app will
                    be
                    in. Web apps have become increasingly more complex and creating a stylesheet for every form of state
                    in
                    your app could cause complications. In this blog post, we’ll learn how we can use finite state
                    machines
                    to create interactive and complex transitions in our apps.</p>

        <!-- Ending Paragraph   -->
        <p>While these tips will surely help you become a better front-end designer, in the long run, you must always
            remember two things while designing your platform – keep it simple and neat, and don’t forget to create your
            signature style.</p>
